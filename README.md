The Playground Project is an open-source, community-driven website where anyone can create their own web pages using HTML, CSS, and maybe a sprinkle of JavaScript! This is your digital sandbox to experiment, learn, and showcase your skills alongside other creators. (you can be one of the first collaborators for now)

## 🌱 What is This?

Imagine a website where every contributor gets their own "plot" or "land" of digital space to design however they want. That's The Playground Project!

- **🤝 Collaborative**: Everyone works together in one repository, open for everyone regardless of level the goal is to have fun and have the work in progress visible to everyone. A group project if you will.
- **🎨 Creative**: Express yourself with HTML, CSS, and JS
